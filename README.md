# Customs-Clearance-MIS
MIS created for Export Import shipment

STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE ON HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT
1.Download Files: First, download the Python (23121106_code.py) file containing the code and
the text (clearance_data.txt) file containing clearance data.
2.Save in Same Folder: Save both files in the same folder on your computer. Make sure they are
in the same directory to ensure the code can access the data file correctly.
3.Run the file in Visual Studio Code.
4.Interact with the Program: Once the code is running, a graphical user interface (GUI) will
appear, allowing you to interact with the customs clearance management system. You can add
new clearance records, display existing records, edit records, and print records as a PDF.
